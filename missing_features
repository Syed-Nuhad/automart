Must-have (stability & correctness)

Store gateway evidence
Save PayPal capture_id, payer_id, email, and raw response JSON on Order for audits & support.

Verify webhooks cryptographically
Validate PayPal webhook signatures (Transmission-Id/Time/Signature) instead of trusting raw posts.

Double-sell protection for cars
On capture: re-check car availability inside a DB transaction; mark car sold and hide listing; remove it from other carts/wishlists.

Idempotency everywhere
Prevent duplicate orders/captures if user double-clicks or refreshes (you partly do this—extend it on return URL & webhook).

Price integrity
Recompute totals from DB prices at create/capture time (not session), and fail if mismatch.

Should-have (UX & operations)

Order emails
Send confirmation email on paid (and failure/cancel). Include order summary and support contact.

Refunds / cancellations
Admin-triggered partial/full refunds via PayPal Refund API; mirror status locally (refunded, partially_refunded).

Terms/consent checkbox at checkout
Store a boolean + timestamp on Order (regulatory/chargeback protection).

Better order list UX
Pagination, search by status/date, and clearer amounts (you’re close—just add paging & filters).

Loading/disabled states on buttons
Prevents accidental resubmits; small JS tweak on “Proceed to Checkout”.

Nice-to-have (business & scaling)

Deposits vs full payment
Allow paying a reservation deposit; track remaining balance and a “Pay remaining” flow.

Promo/discount support
Simple fixed/percent discounts with code redemption and audit trail.

Geo taxes/fees
Compute tax per region instead of a static rate; store tax breakdown per line.

Admin order dashboard
Export CSV, status timeline (created → pending → paid → refunded), and quick links to PayPal.

Analytics & logging
Structured logs for payment events + basic dashboards (success/fail rates, revenue).
