Task (read carefully — do NOT change the Dealer model):

I am sharing my current code below. Your job: implement the **backend** feature so admin users can select a seller for a Car by **name** (UX like the existing `make` field — popup lookup or autocomplete) and have the Car form **auto-fill** the denormalized seller fields (`seller_name`, `seller_meta`, `seller_email`, `seller_phone`, `seller_image`) from the chosen Dealer before save. Important constraints:

1. DO NOT modify the Dealer model file — treat it as read-only.
2. Backend only — do not add any frontend map UI now.
3. Provide a staff-only JSON endpoint (admin-protected) that returns Dealer details used for autofill.
4. Add the `seller` selection to the Car admin (popup/lookup like `make`, or autocomplete — state tradeoffs).
5. Provide a migration or management command to populate existing Car rows that already have a seller FK.
6. Use denormalized copy on Car (so saved Car retains seller data even if Dealer later changes/deletes).
7. Prefer `SET_NULL` for FK deletion safety; explain if you choose otherwise.
8. Return a plan + checklist + QA test steps. Only include code changes after I confirm the plan.

Confirm you received the code, show a short plan, and list the exact files you'll change. Do not change any models in the pasted code unless I explicitly ask.
